# React JS 19 â€“  Roadmap

### Duration: 2 Months

**Technologies Covered:**

* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* React (Basic to Advanced)
* Next.js
* React Native
* Testing & Deployment
* Redux
* End-to-End Project

---

## 1. What is React?

* **React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

| Version        | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Up to 18       | React is a JavaScript library for building **Web UI**            |
| 18.x and above | React is a JavaScript library for building **Web and Native UI** |

## 2. What is the difference between React & Angular?

| Feature      | React                                    | Angular                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type         | Library                                  | Framework                                                              |
| Use Case     | Applications with complex backend stacks | Applications where frontend needs strong control over application flow |
| Architecture | 30% Frontend / 70% Backend               | 70% Frontend / 30% Backend                                             |

## 3. What is the difference between React & React JS?

* **Both are the same.**
* Modern term used: **React**

---

## 4. Why do we need technologies like React and Angular in modern web UI?

To build:

* **SPA** â€“ Single Page Applications
* **PWA** â€“ Progressive Web Applications

Limitations of traditional JavaScript/jQuery:

* Excessive **DOM manipulations**
* Too much **boilerplate coding**
* Poor **code reusability** and **extensibility**
* Weak **code-level security**
* Too many **explicit Ajax calls**

---

## 5. Challenges in Modern Web Development

### ðŸ”„ Unified UX

* Consistent experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Mobile users should access all features

### ðŸŒŠ Fluid UX

* Users interact with the application from a single page
* New content loads **without reloading the page**

### ðŸ”Œ Loosely Coupled & Extensible Systems

* Add new features **without breaking existing ones**
* Modular architecture for **lightweight, pluggable features**

> âœ… **Solution:** Build a **SPA (Single Page Application)**

---

## React Features

*(You can list the features here when you're ready. Some common ones to get you started):*

* Declarative UI
* Component-Based Architecture
* Virtual DOM
* One-Way Data Binding
* JSX â€“ JavaScript XML
* Hooks API
* Concurrent Mode (from React 18+)
* Server Components (React 19+)
* Improved Developer Tooling
* Ecosystem support (Next.js, Redux, etc.)
